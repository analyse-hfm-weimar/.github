# CAMAT — A Comprehensive Cloud-Based Toolbox for Sheet Music Analysis

This GitHub organization hosts the development of **CAMAT**, an open-source, Python-based toolbox for **interactive sheet music analysis**, as well as the **research corpora** produced within the project.

Starting in **September 2025**, CAMAT will be **redeveloped and substantially extended** as part of the research project:

> **A Comprehensive Cloud-Based Toolbox for Sheet Music Analysis**

The project is funded by the **German Research Foundation (DFG)** under the program *Library and Information Services – E-Research Technologies (LIS)* (Grant no. **PF 669/18-1**) and runs from **September 2025 to August 2028**.

## Project Overview

The goal of CAMAT is to provide a **comprehensive, modular, and reproducible environment** for the computational analysis of symbolic music data. The toolbox is designed to support both **exploratory and large-scale analytical workflows** in musicology, music theory, and music pedagogy.

CAMAT integrates established tools and standards for symbolic music representation and analysis, combining:

* **Interactive score rendering**
* **Annotation and visualization**
* **Statistical and corpus-based analysis**
* **Pattern-search methods** for melodic, harmonic, rhythmic, and textural features

A strong emphasis is placed on **open data**, **open workflows**, and **reproducibility** via Jupyter-based research environments.

## What You Will Find Here

* 📦 **CAMAT core libraries and extensions**
* 📊 **Jupyter notebooks** demonstrating reproducible analytical workflows
* 🎼 **Symbolic music corpora** in MEI and related formats
* 🧪 **Alpha releases** and experimental features during development
* 📄 **Documentation and examples** for researchers and educators

## Project Status

🚧 **Development starts: September 2025**
During the early phase, repositories will be added incrementally. Expect:

* Early **alpha releases**
* Corpora and dataset releases
* Demo and tutorial notebooks
* Presentation materials from conferences and workshops
